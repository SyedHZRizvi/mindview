// GET /api/me — returns the current user (driven by the mv_session cookie).
//
// Response shape (kept compatible with the previous Cloudflare-Access-JWT
// version that index.html / admin/dashboard.html / admin/users.html consume):
//

//     authenticated: true,
//     user: { id, email, full_name, role, role_label, can_manage_users }

// {authenticated:false} so the home page can render without triggering a
// redirect loop with the middleware. (The middleware itself doesn't gate
// /api/me precisely so this endpoint can be polled safely.)
